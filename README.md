# Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results

### Introduction
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page,
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### Statistics used:
* Probability
* A/B Test
* Regression

### Tech stack:
Tools I used to complete the project:
* [Anaconda] used to manage packages and environments for use with Python.
* [Jupyter] used to data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation and data visualization.


### Main findings:
* There is no statistical significant that the new page is better than the old page
* The company should keep the old page
* The company should run the experiment about 20 days longer or starts develop another new page
* There are no statistical significant relationship between each country with converts
